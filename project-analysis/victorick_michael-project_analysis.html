			<h2>Site Intent</h2>
			<p>In order to provide a better user experience across all the newer interfaces (desktop/iphone/ipad/etc...) Poinciana Christian Church’s website, <strong><a href="http://poincianacc.org" target="_blank">www.poincianacc.org</a></strong> needs to be brought up to standards with the newest technologies. The overall code does not meet W3C’s validation standards and this also must be addressed. While the design is not as bad as some sights seen on the web it could use a more current design(call it a face lift).  Condensing the navigation and pages down to six and organizing the content to better flow for the user will also help in this website redesign.</p>

			<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
			<p>Alexa data states that Poinciana Christian Church is ranked <strong>15,381,539</strong> and there really are no keywords tied to the website. This will be something else that we would have to address in the redesign.</p>

<!-- ...........................Targeted Audience................................ -->				
			
			
		<section class="target">
			<h2>Target Audience</h2>
			<p>The target audience is very broad as this is a organization that caters to “ministries” ranging from nursery to singles to small groups to missions. The main target is for families with an average income of $42,000(estimates as of 2009) with 2-4 kids. The needs from this group are to have a spiritual fulfillment and a chance to show their children the values they feel they should teach their children. The families need to feel like they belong to a family that outstretches their own. They are looking for guidance to believe in something that is spiritual.</p>
			<p>Jeff & Grace are a husband and wife of 21 years with 2 children, Keith(16) and Bella(4). Jeff works at the local airport and brings home after taxes $40,000. Grace is a stay at home mother and stays in involved with mother’s day out programs through the church. Jeff & Grace look for a group that is trustworthy and that they can be close with, almost like a family. They want a consistency in their life spiritually.</p>
